# Vehicle Detection from video
This project detects vehicles from a front camera of a vehicle driving on a highway. First, I used image dataset from KITTI database to train a machine learning algorithm to classify cars from the images. Then, I wrote a video processing pipline to process images and send them to a already trained classifier to detect cars.
